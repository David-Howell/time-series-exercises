## About Time Series
- Time series analysis is about finding patterns in temporal data and making predictions, or forecasting, based on those patterns.

## Why is this different from basic regression? 
- In short, time is dependent. This means that each feature, that is, each new point in time, is dependent on the previous features. In time series, the previous features are the historical points in time.
